Simple logging module, that supports terminal coloring and writing to files.

This module build ontop of [@hibas123/logging](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hibas123/utils).

It extends the default behavior to support Logging to Files out of the Box.

# Getting Started

``` javascript

const Logging = require("@hibas123/nodelogging").Logging;

Logging.log("Hello there");

```

There are different Logging levels, that also apply terminal coloring:

``` javascript
Logging.debug("Debug message")
Logging.log("Log message")
Logging.warning("Warning")
Logging.error(new Error("To less creativity"))
Logging.error("Just an simple message as error")
Logging.errorMessage("Nearly the same as error")
```

All Logging types except the simple error take as many arguments as you want. These will be joined with spaces and serialized with the node util.inspect function. 

# Setup

NodeLogging can work without any configuration, but it may be useful to change the log output folder.

To do so you are capable of creating own instances of the LoggingBase class

``` javascript
   const CustomLogging = new LoggingBase(name | {
      name: "custom", // default undefined
      files: true | false | { //default true
         logfile: "./logs/test.log",
         errorfile: "/var/log/custom.err",
      }
      console: false // default true
   });
```

The name property prefixes the console output with the name. Also if no logfile or errorfile is created the following standard values are used:

- ./logs/all.{name}.log
- ./logs/error.{name}.log

To not use any logfiles just set files to false.

# Plugins

There is a Plugin API available, that makes is possible to add custom Logging Adapter.

``` javascript
const Demo = new LoggingExtended("Demo");
Demo.addAdapter(new DemoAdapter({ color: "rainbow" }));
```

The adapters need to provide a very simple Interface:

``` typescript
interface Adapter {
    init(observable: ObservableInterface<Message>, name?: string): void | Promise<void>;

    flush(sync: true): void;
    flush(sync: false): void | Promise<void>;
}

interface Message {
    type: LoggingTypes;
    name?:string;
    text: {
    	raw: string[],
    	formatted: string[]
    };
    date: Date;
    file: string;
    customColors?:string;
}

enum LoggingTypes {
   Log,
   Warning,
   Error,
   Debug
}
```

The `ObservableInterface` comes from `@hibas123/utils`. It provides a very simple api for subscribing and unsubscribing from the message events.
